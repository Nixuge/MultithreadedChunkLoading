# MultithreadedChunkLoading
A mod that multithreads Minecraft's chunk loading

# Should I use this?
### TLDR; NO

# What does this mod do ?
Basically grows the vanilla threadcount/list sizes for everything that could make chunk compilation/rendering faster, as well as removing the limitations in those functions that could make the chunk loading stop in favor of other rendering elements

# Why shouldn't I use it ?
- Possibly HIGH memory usage (main deal breaker)
- Reduced FPS while chunks are loading, basically prioritizing their compilation over other stuff (tradeoff that you may or may not want, up to you)

# What purpose is it for then
Its intended (and from what I can think of only) purpose is to basically let you crank up your render distance to 32+ and load everything in a solo map at once (eg to take a big screenshot), instead of having to wait 25 years for everything to load with the vanilla settings.

# Why was it made
Mineplex Backup Project, altho a bit late I need to take screenshots of EVERY map, and not having to wait for the maps to load for too much time is a real time saver
